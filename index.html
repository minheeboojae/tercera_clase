      <h4>Hello! We are Yngvi Studios!</h4>
      <p>Our goal is to develop works that explore all the possibilities of the videogame experience. We believe in artisanal work, and we create thinking about how to make a handcrafted game, pouring time and dedication in each and every aspect of our creation: visuals, game mechanics, programming, writing, music, etc.</p>
      <p>We create because we think our stories and experiences are worth sharing. From personal anecdotes, to issues from our history; from the most archetypicals images to intimate beliefs, all of this pours into the fiction and the worlds we create.</p>
      <p>That’s the cornerstone our first work <a href="http://www.torq-game.com/">Torq</a> is based upon.</p>

      <h4>What is Torq?</h4>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sc09XCO6w_Y" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
      <p>Torq is a 2D adventure, exploration game, where you play as Ahtok, a young boy who in his rite of passage to adulthood gets involved in the awakening of old powers by mysterious foreigners. Ahtok is chosen by the forgotten gods of his people to bring balance to his land, and the wristband he wears–the torq– is the symbol that represent this. </p>
      <p>The game is a beautiful blend of 2d looking 3d characters and assets and hand-painted backgrounds. It features an immersive skill system that improves the moves you do the most and allows you to customize your play experience. The setting is rich in a history that you will uncover as you advance through the game.</p>
      <p>Torq is an adventure of discovering, of contemplating the ties that bond us and exploring new horizons. You’ll learn with Ahtok that every great adventure is built with little daily choices. The scene is set, now it is the time of heroes…</p>
